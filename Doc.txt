# Intro
Rigel is a SPA framework.
If you want to use rigel.js in anypage it has to contain a package.json 

# Modules -> A module is a seperate web page that is included in one or more areas.
Rigel uses a package.json to keep track of modules and their version.
You can set it up by defining a meta tage like this :
   
   <meta name="Rigel-package" content="content of package.json here">

Loading a module : 

   let module = new Rigel.
